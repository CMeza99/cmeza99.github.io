## I Do Computers

I am a developer, system administrator, “computer guy”. I am mostly self taught, originally through brute force, then books, and now YouTube.

### Linux (and Unix)

I am very much an open source enthusiast. I run [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) on my servers and [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) on my desktops. I use [vim](http://www.vim.org/), not [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

## How It Started

My fascination with computers stems from my curiosity to understand how this box creates an image I can see. When my aunt game my first computer, an [IBM PS/2 Model 70](/my-first-computer_1995-06-28/), I immediately wanted to understand how it works. So the first thing I did, was take it apart. Afterwards I could not get it boot back into the OS (DOS) (my parents were less than pleased). It did how ever boot in to a BASIC interpreter, which I learned how to use. Eventually, I received assistance from my mother's coworker in making it work again, but still did not understand how it worked.

I proceed to study how the components of the computer worked. I learned solid state circuitry, resistor, capacitors, and transistors. Then I learned digital circuity, gates and microprocessors. Then I finally learned how a CRT (cathode ray tube) worked. The great mystery was finally solved years later. But this empowered me to mod devices, unlock CPUs, overclock motherboards, mess with voltages on telephones.

Much my education in electronics is attributed to my high school, [Don Bosco Technical Institute](https://www.boscotech.edu/). I chose to go to this school, largely impart for its computer and electronic courses. Fortunate for me, I had parents willing to make the sacrifice to allow me to go to the most expensive Catholic high school in the area.

## Where I Come From

I am a proud native Angeleno (inhabitant of Los Angeles, CA). I am the product of a large metropolis and encompass the diversity it offers. And I can not imagine my life without the Pacific Ocean. L.A. isn't perfect, but where I come from, it's my home.

I am the first son of two boys. When I was born, my family lived in [Highland Park, Los Angeles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Park,_Los_Angeles).  At the time, I remember as a primary Hispanic and low income neighborhood. After the birth my brother, my parents wanted to raise their children in a different environment. We would move to [Pico Rivera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_Rivera,_California), CA and then move a few times within [Whittier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_California), CA. Because of this, the [SGV (San Gabriel Valley)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Valley) is the area of Los Angeles that I feel most at home.

## Fun Beyond Computers

Video games, it's all their fault. That is where my fascination with electronic began. I have burned so many hours on video games. My [NES (Nintendo Entertainment System)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) got used heavily growing up. Games like [Half-Life Counter-Strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike) and [Grand Theft Auto Vice City](http://www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/) would proved to be so time consuming, I do not invest myself into learning new games as much anymore. But, I still enjoy play classic games, like the [Centipede](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_%28video_game%29) ROM on MAME [(Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator)](http://mamedev.org/).

Board games and pinball are non-video games that I enjoy. Though theses can be just as consuming as video games.

I also enjoy the Los Angeles nightlife, in particular the music. I can go from watching the [LAPhil](http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/philpedia/los-angeles-philharmonic) at the Hollywood Bowl one night and underground hip hop music at [The Echoplex](http://www.theecho.com)the next.

As I have delved deeper into the infosec world, I starting to entertain myself with physical penetration. Not looking to do anything professional with this just yet.

Of course I like attending user groups, but now we are moving back in to computers.
