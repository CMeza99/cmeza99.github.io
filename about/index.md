## I Do Computers

I enjoy playing with hardware and software. I have held positions from Systems Administrator to DevOps Engineer. When non technical people ask me about what I do, I usually just some it up as, “I do computers.”

I am mostly self taught. At a young age, my parents signed me up for an weekend electronics class at the [California Science Center](http://californiasciencecenter.org/). I immediately fascinated by electricity. Later I would stumble upon a [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) programming language tutorial and immediately felt empowered. My passion gave me the self-motivation to seek more knowledge about computers and related fields.

Areas of particular interest of mine include Linux, automation (scripting), and web development, and security (a.k.a. hacking). I continue to have a desire to return to hardware; to play with devices such as Ardino and the Bengal Board. I am also a proponent of open source development.

In addition to my day job, I currently perform independent consulting under the DBA, digitalRoots. My main work as digitalRoots is assisting community groups and nonprofit organizations. Most of the time this work is volunteer jobs. When I attend conferences, I also used the digitalRoots moniker.

## Techie Background

### Open Source
I have become completely engrossed with the open source philosophy and community. I am an enthusiast and proponent of it. I love how the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html) license is a hack of copyright law to create “copyleft”. The community is composed of people who are passion and want to share knowledge. The open source community is an amazing thing. But most important of all is the empowerment that open source brings to others.

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) is another licensing model that has helped facility the sharing of intellectual property. It is not exactly open source, but shares in the spirit. I am naturally attracted to such things, because people who are interested in such things, are people that want to create things that empowers others.

It would not be complete to address open source without mentioning [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/). He did after all give birth to GNU, which result in us have GNU/Linux today. I do agree with many of his perspectives, but do find them to be practical for most people to implement today.

#### Linux (and Unix)

After some experimentation early on in my career, as an independent consultant I began to deploy CentOS boxes. But I was not ready to move to it as my desktop as my workflow was very ingrained in the MS Windows environment. I started to play with different distributions in VirtualBox. I tried Puppy Linux, Mint, and Ubuntu. Eventually I would migrate to lubuntu and install it on the bare-metal of my workstation.

I started attending a Linux User Group, the SGV LUG. That got me deeper into Linux. Another member convinced me to try Gentoo. I thought compiling a kernel was beyond me. After some long nights of experimenting I finally got Gentoo to boot. Afterwards I would tailor it to run in a Hyper-V environment so I could put it into production at my current employer. The virtual machine would run Python and Ruby scripts that would generate static website files and manipulate images for me. This was a proud moment for me, now I felt like I had really embraced Linux.

After that experience, [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) had started generating a lot of buzz. I had heard a lot of good things about it and I was curious. I was struggling with making the effort of learning a new package management system and the caviouts of a different distro. But, I appeared that many of the more “hardcore” Linux users were moving over to it. So when one of my workstations got botched, I installed Arch Linux. It took me a couple days to do my first install, but I got it up. After I became familiar with it, Arch would become my distro of choice for my desktop machines.

I have been experimenting more with the BSDs recently. I am setting up OpenBSD in virtualized labs and noncritical production components to become more familiar with it, prior to making part of any critical infrastructure.

PC-BSD has some very compelling features. But there are a few things that are preventing me from diving in to BSD on my desktop. I run my workstation as a KVM host, but was unsuccessful in getting PC-BSD to operate in a virtual environment. I also worry about the hardware compatibility.

#### Editor War
I use [vim](http://www.vim.org/), not [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Vim has an endless supply of plugins that allow me to modify for any text editing need. Emacs is over bloated. I had to use once for part of a BASH scripting class I took. I was the worse part of the class.

### System Administrator

I have been administering servers since I was a teenage. Amazing, I have even have experience with AS/400s and Novell.

Much of my early career was around [Windows Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server) from [NT 3.51](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.51)+ and various implementations of DOS and [Windows 3.11 for Workgroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x#Windows_for_Workgroups_3.11). I played with a Linux server I setup and got Xorg load and turned it into a web and file server for me share pictures with the department. Later I would turn this box in to a [Counter-Strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike) Linux server (which eventually got shutdown due to complaints from the networking team).

During my time as an independent consultant, I began looking for tools that were lower cost and free. I came across two important topics, virutalization and open source development. At the time there was (VMware Server](https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/server_pubs.html). That would be my and my clients' introduction to virtualization. I also had rediscovered linux and started deploying [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) wherever I could. At this same time, I found [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) projects, like [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org) and [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/). I began building my own NASs and firewalls. This was all quite exciting for me.

### Developer
Programming was a secondary fascination of mine, with electronics being primary. But over the years that has change. Currently I wish to pursue scripting languages for automation more heavily. I do have some experience with Ruby and Python. Many of the “DevOps” tools can be implemented to may SysAdmins lives easier.

My first language was BASIC, then I jumped to C++. C++ was interesting to me. I saw the power it had to manipulate the hardware I wanted to build. I started using C++ to wrap x86 Assembly and that was very exciting for me.

Later, I would start dabbling in web development. I had played with some JavaScript, Perl and CGI scripts, but PHP is what got my attention. It was clear that I was far more interested in backend development then UX. I tried out and created modules for several content management systems. As I have gone a little deeper in web development, I have notice many tools are built in Ruby. So I started learning Ruby.

Now I am focusing on Python as there are many web development tools in that language, as well as DevOps type tools
