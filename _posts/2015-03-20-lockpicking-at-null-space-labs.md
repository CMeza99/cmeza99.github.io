I had met serveral of NSL peeps at [Def Con XXI](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-index.html). But even before that, I wanted to checkout their facility. I finally made it out to their [lockpicking group](http://032.la/events/52/lockpicking/) night. It was very informative and fun (even though I could get past opening a lock with a couple pins in it). They went into many other phsyical security topics. I expect I'll be coming back.
