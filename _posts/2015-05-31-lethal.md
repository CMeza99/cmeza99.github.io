[LETHAL](http://www.meetup.com/LETHAL/) is a group that I have been wanting to check out since the beginning of the year, but because of other obligations, like Interop last month, I have not been able to attend. But this Sunday was different and I finally made it.

I got to the meetup and there was a few people I had meet from the [LayerOne](/layerone_2015-05-24/) conference and [Null Space Labs](http://032.la/).

The meetup was loosely ran, but had an agenda. Everyone was there because they were an enthusiast. It felt very evident that the objective of this meetup is knowledge sharing, even though it was not said.

The speakers varied on experience. This made for a wide range of topic at various skill levels. This is also encouraging for those attempting to give their first talk.

I expect to be back in June, if I am not at [Code Camp](http://www.socalcodecamp.com/).
