I remember how execited I was to get my first CD burner. It felt so empowering. When I made the decision it was because I wanted Windows NT 3.51 (yes, Windows; I was young and didn't know better). The Windows NT Server software was retailing at $500, but at the same time the only CD burner compatible with my equipment had come down in price to $500. The choice was clear to me, with the burner I would be able to capture all the Microsoft Select CDs from work. This was pre-torrent days, even pre-Napster. Also, to download warez at the time was painfully slow when I was not at my work's T1. What can I say, it was the 90's.

The CD burner was an HP Surestore CD-Writer 6020ep. I was the only one that I was aware of that was compatible with my equipment. At the time all burners had SCSI interfaces. I did not have such a fancy machine. But HP managed to create a scsi to parallel port adapter for it. It had issues. I could not do anything else while it was burning, or risk interupting the burn process. But it did the job for me. What was really cool is that it had an extra parallel port interface on it so that I can still have my printer connect.
