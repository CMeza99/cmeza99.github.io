I was excited to be at the [keynote](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/opening-keynote-only-you-can-get-so-where-are-you.html) being give by [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/speakers/lawrence-lessig.html). I have great admiration for his contributions like [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/). Also, I agree with many of his perspectives, some of which he shares in [RiP: A remix manifesto](http://ripremix.com/).

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with what I heard. Revolution was convoluted with reform. This is upsetting as I am sure Lawrence Lessig understands the difference. Also, he proceeds to leverage [Aaron Swartz]'s(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) for his agenda. While it is true Aaron left us with organizations like [Demand Progress](https://demandprogress.org/), I believe it obvious that he did not expect the system and reformist actions to bring about meaningful change. A great example of this is efforts to liberate data (i.e [JSTOR](http://docs.jstor.org/)). Even the language of “liberate” demonstrates anarchist ideology.

The final slap in the face by Lawrence was he response to an older black man, who lived through the civil rights  era, criticized Lawrence reformist rhetoric. This man was the only voice of discontent. He shared his experience of resistance to the establishment. Rather then taking this man's perspective as an opportunity to grow and debate, Lawrence dismissed him. The tactic to dismissed and belittle discontent is done all too often with entities invested in the status quo.
