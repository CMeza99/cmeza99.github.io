I learned of a [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripting class being taught at [Pasadena City College](http://www.pasadena.edu/), CS 18. I decided to sign up for it in order to help refine my Linux skills. To my surprise I got a lot more out of it than I expected. Thank you to [John Segui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsegui) who taught the class.
