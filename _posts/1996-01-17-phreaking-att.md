Like most engineers, I was curious about how the systems around me worked. The phone system was no exception. I had learned some basics of how telephones of the time worked, i.e. voltage levels, 4 "hidden" operator tones, etc. I had also notice that if the phone was taken of the hook, put back on, and then taken off quickly, that it would not always return to a dial tone. I eventually learned that if I did this four times in a row I would get into the operator menu. This menu appeared to be for payphone buy was accessible on any phone wired by a copper pair. I was never brave enough to attempted do anything with it, though I wish I test the coin return feature. Eventually this exploit was removed.
