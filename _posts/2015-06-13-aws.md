Today I stood up my first instance in AWS. I attended a workshop at [Null Space Labs](http://032.la/), [Getting Started with Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://www.meetup.com/NullSpaceLabs/events/222877628/), lead by bV.

He went through expanding the concepts and benefits of virtualization and offloading that work load. Then he went over quite a number of the different components of AWS like EC2, S3, Route 53, etc. Also covered was the pricing models that Amazon users, which in my opinion was a little complicated.

Finally it was time to get hands on. After struggling to get Amazon to validate my account, I opened up the AWS Management console. There was everything I needed to access up front. Initially a little over whelming, it didn't take long to understand how it is organized. So I proceed to create my first micro instance. I chose RHEL as I do not often have the opportunity to deploy RedHat for free. Once I tweaked my virtual machine to my liking, I fired it up. I had AWS create the key pair, download the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) file, and ssh-ed in. Of course the first thing I did was install some of my standard tools like VIM. I wanted to turn it into a Docker server, but to my disappointment, the default RHEL instance does not come with a subscription to the extras repository.

//Update: // I have since learned that I can add the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL). This may be the answer to my problem. At a minimum, I am gaining more exposure to RedHad which was my secondary goal.

I am excited to continue my investigation of AWS and become familiar with tools like [boto](https://boto.readthedocs.org), a Python AWS SDK.
