[LayerOne ](http//www.layerone.org/) is Los Angeles' premier security conference. On May23-24, 2015 the 16th annual LayerOne conference took place. I was make aware of this event because many of the organizers are from [Null Space Labs](http://032.la/), where I attend the monthly [lock picking class](http://www.carlosisawesome.com/lockpicking-at-null-space-labs_2015-03-20/).  This was my first year in attendance.

The crowd consisted of a number of characters that I recognize from the hacker-spaces and users groups in the area. There was also a number people I have not seen since [DefCon XXI](/defcon-xxi_2013-08-04/) and [BsidesLV 2013](/volunteering-at-bsideslv_2013-07-31/). The crowd also had many gray beards mixed in.

The speaker [Sam Bown](https://samsclass.info/), I had previous seen give a talk at [DefCon XXI](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-index.html), [Evil DoS Attacks and Strong Defenses](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2021/DEF%20CON%2021%20video%20and%20slides/DEF%20CON%2021%20Hacking%20Conference%20Presentation%20By%20Sam%20Bowne%20and%20Matthew%20Prince%20-%20Evil%20DoS%20Attacks%20and%20Strong%20Defenses%20-%20Video%20and%20Slides.m4v). This time he presented, [Trojaning Financial Android Apps](http://www.layerone.org/speakers/#sambowne). He demonstrated how trivial it is to disassemble an app into [smali](https://code.google.com/p/smali/) code and that that obfuscation is superficial. This makes it simple to modify the code for one's own purpose. Apps are signed, so this should be difficult to implement except for the fact that the certificate is not  checked against a CA. And when certs are changed, Android only prompts to uninstall and reinstall it. Further more, many apps do not even check the certificate from their own site. With all these vulnerabilities, one can inject code to view things like credentials. He contacted the financial and medical institutions behind the apps he tested, but was usually not even knowledge.  He did find some effectiveness to making contact to a CEO of a company over public media.

A notable talk, [An 0Day in the life (of a researcher)](http://www.layerone.org/speakers/#robertrowley), was given by [Robert Rowley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertlei). He went through the struggle of getting a vulnerability patched in [WordPress](https://wordpress.com). The problem was in how WordPress creates cookies and the OAUTH token. He explained the problem to WordPress and was dismissed. He continued by submitting examples demonstrating steps towards taking advantage of the vulnerability. He eventually made an entire POC (proof of concept), at which point, WP finally took noticed and patched the problem in version 4.2. There was no bug bounty, acknowledgment, or even a thank you for his efforts from WP. I suppose the moral of the story is that security research can be a thankless job.

Along with such awesome talks, there were the village, Hardware Hacking, Lock Picking, The Room (espionage style contest), Hacking. Here the lock picking classes, CTF (Capture The Flag), (De)Obfuscation contest, can build the badge were conducted. Unfortunately, the kits for the badge ran out and I was not able to assemble one.

But this was not all of the ongoings happening at LayerOne. There was also the HAM testing, Demo Party (demo board PIC24FJ256DA206), HeboCon Robot Royale (crappy robot battle, e.g. made with part from the 99 cent), dinner/party while playing Diplomacy.

On top of all that, there was an after party hosted at the hackespace, [23b Shop](http://shop.23b.org/). The festivities there were great, homemade soda, gaint Jenga, modded Nerf guns, etc, you get the idea. And of course food! There was a lot of awesome people and great conversations. 

LayerOne was an awesome experience and am really glad I went. There was so much going on, I would not get to all of it. I suppose I will have to go again next year.
