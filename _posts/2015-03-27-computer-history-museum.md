I had wanted to visit the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/) for a very long time, and I finally got to go. The experience was more than I expected. Our tour was led by [Paul Laughton](http://www.laughton.com/Apple/Apple.html), the creator of [DOS 3.1](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/apple-ii-dos-source-code/) for the [Apple II](http://apple2history.org/). It was quite a treat. I did not even know who our tour guide was until he casually mentioned that he wrote the OS for the Apple II toward the end. I also got to see a demonstration of the [Charles Babbage's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) [Difference Engine](http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/) in action, with a great explanation of how it works.
