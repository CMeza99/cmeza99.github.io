I had been providing helpdesk support off and on for a few years. But it was all to evident that I had many gaps in my knowledge of computers. I decided to remedy this with a book, as the Web was still early developemnt and there was no Google. I finally found "Upgrading and Repairing PCs" by Scott Miller. It seemed thorough, easy to follow, and had pictures (I mean diagrams). I had no idea how much this book would propel me forward.
