I finally have a full on website that will be maintained!

I have attempted to have websites in the past but for one reason or another I end up abandoning them. I have tried [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and other CMSs (Content Management System). And I have even gone as far as to develop modules/plugins for them. This complexity added to the workload necessary to maintain a site. Also in an effort to save money, I believed that I could go with a free hosting company since my site was just a low traffic php site. But these hosting companies would disappear, have outages, or kill my account because it was not active. The end results were not good for me.

A few years ago I learned [git](http://git-scm.com/) and started keeping repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I learned about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but felt they were not powerful enough for me. After struggling to created a website for a nonprofit organization, that I would not have to maintain, I decided to try moving them to Github Pages. The logic was that if they knew enough to setup a static HTML/CSS site, they would be able to create post in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). And I was right! It was a success. The simplicity in options but able to execute what they needed allowed for quick and easy adoption.

After setting up a GitHub Page for someone else, I realized this is also what I needed. I needed something simple yet allowed me customization without needing to maintain the underlining CMS. Initially it was a little difficult to let go of not being able to create my own addons for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but that freed me up to work on the content. This was a huge improvement for me. And on top of things  it is free!

I still have a lot of work to do on the website, but it making progress. My primary focus is getting content up. I have made several back post to help seed the site. Secondary is the template/themeing. It currently looks okay and is completely functional on mobile devices.

I am eagerly watching the site climb in the Google search results. I will be so happy once it appears in the top 10 results for Carlos Meza.
