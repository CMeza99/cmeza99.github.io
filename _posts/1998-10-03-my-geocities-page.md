My first website was on the infamous, and now defunct, [GeoCities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities). I had learned some [HTML 4.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/) by read the help files from a piece of software I download from a warez site, HotDog by [Sausage Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage_Software). It was way better than [Dreamweaver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver) or [Frontpage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage).

I have no copy of this webpage, but I believe that may be for the best.
