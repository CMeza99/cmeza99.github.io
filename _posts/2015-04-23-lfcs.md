I finally took my first certification exam, the [LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator)](http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs). And yes, I passed.

This being my first certification exam, I had a bit of anxiety about taking the exam. I was not sure is I was adequately prepared. Sure, I studied each of the points listed in Domains and Competencies in the [Certification Preparation Guide](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/download-free-certification-prep-guide). But I did not know exactly how the exam would go. This is was not your typical multiple choice and fill in the blank. I was test on my ability to execute tasks.

Being tested on results versus just a static response to question definitely requires better comprehension over just memorization. Because of this I went deeper on the subject matter then necessary for the exam, especially with BASH scripting. Of course, this will benefit me, but I caused myself unnecessary stress over the certification exam.

I found this to be a more practical approach then something like the [LPIC](https://www.lpi.org/certification/get-certified-lpi/lpic-1-linux-server-professional/)/[Linux+](http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx). Admittedly, I have not taken the LPIC/Linux+ exam, but I was originally studding for it.

The worse part of the exam was waiting for the results. The exam states that it may take three business day. But I was told that its usually done with in 24 hours. Well, I had to wait until very late of the third business to get confirmation that I passed.

This demonstrates the I have an understanding of basic configuration and naviation of a GNU Linux system, but I am still very happy to have received my first cert. Now on to the LCFE (Linux Foundation Certified Engineer)?
