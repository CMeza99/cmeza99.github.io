I am extremely excited to be at my first [DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/). I was not originally planning on going, but while at [BsidesLV 2014](/volunteering-at-bsideslv_2013-07-31/), I could not rationalize not going.

[Defcon XXI](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-index.html) was an a great time with an overwhelming amount of information. I got meet and hangeout with a number of people from the [EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), [Int eighty](https://twitter.com/dualcoremusic) of [DualCore](http://dualcoremusic.com), and party with the hacker groups from different areas.
