### About the bootcamp
> This free program is designed to improve the Drupal skills of beginner- to` intermediate-level Drupal and PHP developers. Together as a group, we're diving into Drupal's APIs and helper functions, developing custom modules (many of us for the first time), using version control and other Drupal developer best practices, and advancing our Drupal skills to the next level.
