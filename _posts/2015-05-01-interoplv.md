I'm back at InteropNet! My first time as being part of InteropNet and the NOC (Network Operations Center) two years ago was a great experience. Last time there was so much to learn from so many wonderful people and this year was no exception.

Again, we arrive and then immediately hit the ground running. We only have a few days to deploy the world's largest temporary network. Yes, everything is pre-built and tested at the hot-stage in south San Francisco. But when packing up and shipping an entire network, things are bound to break; routing tables change, tons of layer one issues, conference organizers making last minutes changes, and of course sometimes hardware decides to fail.

Besides just getting the Interop network up, the InteropNet Lab was demoing the future of networking, SDN (Software Defined Networking).  The vendors that were showing off what the can do include: [HP](http://www.hp.com/sdn), [Netronome](https://netronome.com/), Alcatel-Lucent/[NEC](http://www.necam.com/SDN/), and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/sdn/index.html). This is my first exposure to SDN like this. HP is running such a high amount of DNS queries out of their SDN stack that the physical HP router on the edge started failing! (In all fairness the edge device is about 8 years old). Of course, interoperability between SDN networks is being attempted. Tests are not looking good. Interoperability and wide adpotence of SDN may still be a few years off.

Being an ITM (InteropNet Team Member), we are privileged to have “private classes”. This is organized by Brian Chee. He gathers vendors and professionals also working in the NOC to share there knowledge. Topics range from layer one 10G+, to emerging standards like DANE on DNSSec. Knowledge sharing is strongly encouraged in the NOC.

Of course there is the actual conference as well. [Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/) sponsored an InfoSec track. There was much talk about SDN of course. But what was particularly interesting to me, was the amount of discussion on Linux containers. It was very exciting for me to hear that the enterprise was finally taking note of this technology. One of my favorite talks was [Container Challenges: Know Before You Deploy](http://www.interop.com/lasvegas/scheduler/session/container-challenges-know-before-you-deploy) given by [Scott Lowe](http://blog.scottlowe.org/), Engineering Architect for Vmware.

Lastly, there is the expo floor. While many booths did have the exhibitor's engineers, it was still flooded with sales people and people there just to collect my personal information. Though one of the most impressive things I saw at Interop was at the SanDisk booth. They have a high-density and low-latency flash sttoage appliance, [InfiniFlash System](http://www.sandisk.com/events/interop/).

I cannot wait until the next InteropLV 2016, May 2-6. Not only am I eager to see learn and see how technology has advanced across the year, but to reunite with my InteropNet family.
