At [ScaLE 13x](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x) I attended the [Chef training workshop](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/chef-training-workshop). If was very informative and provided me with more then enough info to deploy recipes and tests.

It was co-hosted by [Ned Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedharris), whom I have previously met at [SoCal Code Camp](http://www.socalcodecamp.com/). He is very helpful and enthusiastic about Chef. He is willing to answer any and all questions about Chef.
