I had the pleasure to chat with [Nate Kartchner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natekartchner) of the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/). We compared the the [Linux Foundation Certification](http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification) with the [LPI certification/Linux+](https://www.lpi.org/). I did challenge him on the industry acceptance of the LFCS (Certified Sysadmin) and LFCE (Certified Engineer). He was very open to my critics. His rebuttal was to allow me to take one of the test at a reduced cost with the caveat that I send him my opinion/review of the test. Hopefully we will being posting my new certification. Thank you Nate and Linux Foundation.
