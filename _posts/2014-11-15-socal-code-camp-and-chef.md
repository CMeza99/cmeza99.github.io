What made this [SoCal Code Camp](http://www.socalcodecamp.com/) a little extra special was getting to meet and hang out with [Ned Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedharris) of the [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) project. His [talk](http://www.socalcodecamp.com/socalcodecamp/session.aspx?sid=b2ce3a54-19f6-403a-b682-6347d584d43f) was a good primer as I have been interested in diving into this configuration management tool.
